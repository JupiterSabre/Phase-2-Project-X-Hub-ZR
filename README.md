#XXXXXXXXXX  SECRET SOHO SOCIAL CLUB HUB

A digital place for our mmembers to stay in the loop, or venture out of it.

--> This website is a template digital space for a private social club that specializes in curating programming in novel, remote, wonder-inducing locations.

This hub is meant to be iterated on for the fall season.

##Home Page: Your invitation. Lucky you if you have access. Click the sign up sheet to apply for the fall season.

##Happenings: A gallery style catalog of past events & collaborations. Click on an image for fill view, double click for exit view.
--> A calendar of geo located programming within a 2-week period. Book an IV session or full body massage ahead of time.


##Curiosity: A display of notable testimonials from club members.
-->Future Deliverable: An interactive map for marking places been, places soon to be, & upcoming events with on hover popups with detailed information. Gallery images will be indexed and mapped to the interactive map at some point.

#Conspire: A form for pitching collaborations, private programming, sponsorship, or feedback in general.
--> An experimental form for testimonials, on the backend it takes in a testimony input and paraphrases the submission in iambic pentameter.

Other future deliverables:
Proper login page.
Payment services (probably stripe)
Dynamic menu page for in club orders























# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
